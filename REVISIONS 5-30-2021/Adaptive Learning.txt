[1] Adaptive learning activities can respond to a learner’s needs in real time, facilitating the development of higher-level skills including bringing together knowledge from different disciplines to solve real-world problems.

[2] Adaptive games are considered superior over non-adaptive games due to the fact that the children's performance are assessed constantly and adjust the difficulty of activities to match the children's individual level.

[3] (1) apart from learners’ cognitive ability, it is important to consider affective factors such as motivation in adaptive learning, (2) lack of alignment among various components in an adaptive system can impact how learners accessed the system and, more importantly, their performance, and (3) visualizations can reveal interesting findings that can be missed otherwise.
